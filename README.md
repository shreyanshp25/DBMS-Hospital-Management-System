# DBMS-Hospital-Management-System
## Abstract
This is a typical representation of a hospital where there are a number of job
profiles like doctors, nurses, ward boys, dispensaries and many more. It is a
lucid structure to give a pragmatic view of all the individual entities, and how
well they are related with each other and on what parameters. What we plan
to implement is specializing a hospital class into subclasses, so that it gets easy
to manage all the individuals who are a part of this eco system.
The entire structure which manifests a hospital will be having several
departments like orthopaedic, neurology, and many more. Each department in
turn will have several doctors with different points of specializations, then
under every doctor there will be some nurses to manage patients. There needs
to be separate categorization of patients and which particular doctor they
want to consult, and on which date.
