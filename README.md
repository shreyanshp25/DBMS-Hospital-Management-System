## DBMS-Hospital-Management-System
# Abstract
This is a typical representation of a hospital where there are a number of job
profiles like doctors, nurses, ward boys, dispensaries and many more. It is a
lucid structure to give a pragmatic view of all the individual entities, and how
well they are related with each other and on what parameters. What we plan
to implement is specializing a hospital class into subclasses, so that it gets easy
to manage all the individuals who are a part of this eco system.
The entire structure which manifests a hospital will be having several
departments like orthopaedic, neurology, and many more. Each department in
turn will have several doctors with different points of specializations, then
under every doctor there will be some nurses to manage patients. There needs
to be separate categorization of patients and which particular doctor they
want to consult, and on which date.
# Working Hierarchy
* Hospital has several departments, all the departments in a particular
hospital will be in the department entity.
* Hospital has further relations with dispensary table which will keep
record of all the medicines allocated for a particular department along
with the disease name. Department table also shares a one to many
relationship with doctor table.
* Doctor entity consists of entities describing details about the doctors
and the department which they belong to.
* Then there are patient and patient history entities to store details about
the patients and their medical
# Functionalities
* A patient adds him/her in a particular hospital for further consultations.

* After that that patient gets to book an appointment with any doctor of
their choice. Entities of patient history entity are updated or added by
doctors when a patient consults them for a particular ailment.
* Departments table is created and altered by hospital management.
* Every department manages all the doctors which falls under it through
the department and doctor entity. They also get to access the medicines
assigned to them through dispensary entity.
* Doctors also get to access the patientâ€™s ailment history through
patient_history entity.
